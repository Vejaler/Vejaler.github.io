> ***"Perfect! Amr is an incredible tutor, and I can't recommend him enough. He goes above and beyond to help his students. He makes sure I understand the concepts completely, and is patient enough to repeat himself however many times you need him to. I feel comfortable asking him questions, and he answers them in a way that you will understand, but by also making sure you're not missing any key information. 10/10 best tutor."***
